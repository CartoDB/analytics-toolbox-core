# SETool

A tool to help develop the Spatial Extension.

## Description

This is a proof of concept to help developers add new code to the extension.

Although we want to reduce the complexity of the modules, a refactoring of the structure must be meditated and may take time.

We offer this tool as an alternative to "copy and paste the skel directory and do all the replacements manually", so contributing becomes much easier and faster.

## Installation

To install or update this tool globally, run:

```bash
cd tools/setool
npm install
npm install -g
```

## Usage

Available commands:

```bash
setool create module
```
