# S2 module for Redshift

S2 is a library for spherical geometry that aims to have the same robustness, flexibility, and performance as the very best planar geometry libraries.

You can learn more about S2 on [their website](https://s2geometry.io/) or in the [Overview section](https://s2geometry.io/).
