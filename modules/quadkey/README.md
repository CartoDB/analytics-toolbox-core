# Quadkey

On this module we use Quadints, our own version of [Quadkeys](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QuadTiles) stored in a INT64. Quadints have multiple advantages as faster comparision, consistent storage or better indexing.

We also provide the functions necessary to parse between Quadints and Quadkeys.
