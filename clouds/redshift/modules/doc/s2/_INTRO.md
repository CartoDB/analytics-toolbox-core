# s2

[S2](https://s2geometry.io/) is a library for spherical geometry that aims to have the same robustness, flexibility, and performance as the very best planar geometry libraries.

You can learn more about S2 in the [Spatial Indexes section](https://docs.carto.com/data-and-analysis/analytics-toolbox-for-redshift/key-concepts/spatial-indexes#s2) of the documentation.
