# s2

Our S2 module is based on a port of the official S2 geometry library created by Google. For more information about S2 check the [library's website](http://s2geometry.io/) or the [Spatial Indexes section](https://docs.carto.com/data-and-analysis/analytics-toolbox-for-snowflake/key-concepts/spatial-indexes#s2) of this documentation.
