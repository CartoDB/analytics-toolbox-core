# CARTO Spatial Extension

The CARTO Spatial Extension is a series of modules that expand the funcionality of geospatial data warehouses, like BigQuery.

## Modules

### Quadkey

Quadkey is a geospatial index based on WebMercator tiles.

### Skel

This is a basic module meant to be used as the foundation to create new modules. It doesn't contain any useful functionality.

## Advanced Modules

In addition to the open source modules found here, CARTO also offers customers access to advanced modules to visualize and analyze data.

### Tiler

The [CARTO BigQuery Tiler](https://carto.com/bigquery/beta/) is a solution to visualize massive amounts of data in BigQuery. Here are a few screenshots of some visualizations created with it:
