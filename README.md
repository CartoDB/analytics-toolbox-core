## ðŸ”¥ UPDATE ##

CARTO is currently working on an entire restructure of this project to include documentation, tests and CI. On the process we will restructure components and do very significant changes. Our goal is to be ready by the end of February. We will be using different BigQuery projects so ETLs or calls to `jslibs.` will keep working. You can still send PRs if you want to, but we recommend waiting for this refactor to be done before investing any significant amount of work. Thanks!

# CARTO Spatial Extension

The CARTO Spatial Extension is a series of modules that expand the funcionality of geospatial data warehouses, like BigQuery.

## Modules

### Quadkey

Quadkey is a geospatial index based on WebMercator tiles.

### Skel

This is a basic module meant to be used as the foundation to create new modules. It doesn't contain any useful functionality.

## Advanced Modules

In addition to the open source modules found here, CARTO also offers customers access to advanced modules to visualize and analyze data.

### Tiler

The [CARTO BigQuery Tiler](https://carto.com/bigquery/beta/) is a solution to visualize massive amounts of data in BigQuery. Here are a few screenshots of some visualizations created with it:
